# Sample Space and Probability

## Sets
- **set**: a collection of objects 
- **elements**: objects in a set
- **empty set**: \\( \emptyset \\)
- **countably infinite**: when a set contains infinitely many elements
    - example, a set of all even numbers
    - infinite, but countable (this is challenging to distinguish from uncountable sets)
- **uncountable set**: a continuous range of elements?
- **subset**: if every element of set S is also an element of set T, S is a subset of T
    - if S < T and T < S, sets are **equal**
- **universal set**: omega 
- **complement of a set**: Sc =  {x is a member of omega | x is not member of S}
- **union**: elements belong to S *or* T
